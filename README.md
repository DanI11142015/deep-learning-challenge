What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

IS_SUCCESSFUL

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
,,
NAME
APPLICATION_TYPE
AFFILIATION
CLASSIFICATION
USE_CASE
ORGANIZATION
INCOME_AMT
ASK_AMT
,,



What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
  The variable that we removed we EIN and NAME as these were not relative to our model. 


How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  I intially selected 2 layers with 5 and 8 nodes to test how the model would run. I saw that this gave an output of accurary of less than 75% so I decided to add a third layer 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  We were able to achieve the target model performace after adding another hidden layer of 30 nodes

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
  There was only one additional step in adding another hidden layer and reciving the desired outcome.
